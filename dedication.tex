This dissertation is dedicated to my wife, Janea, and our little Beckett baby as well as my sister, Shauntel, my brother, Mitchell, and my parents and grandparents who worked so hard to raise me, teach me, and get me to a position where I could even take a shot at this. This is also dedicated to all of the teachers and youth leaders out there who went way beyond the call of duty to invest in us. I hope the returns are fruitful.
