This is a tabulation of those numbers are used so that a more direct comparison is possible between volume. Here, the large errors should be noted. While large numbers of atoms may drive statistical error down when measuring across the entire tip, particles containing only hundreds of solute atoms bears greater uncertainty. Papers that report particle compositions using isosurfaces should be treated with similar uncertainty.
